# VCFotographer

## TODO

- Strategy for multiple VCF files : Should all the screenshots go in the same folder ? Should the variants be sorted ? Should the overlapping variants be merged ?
- Choose how to scale insertions structural events (based on their size or simply some bases around the insertion point)
- Create missing index files ?
